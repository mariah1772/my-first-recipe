    <h1><b>How to Coat 
        Chicken Parmesan</b></h1>
        <p>
            <ul>
                
                    <b>Ingredients </b>
                
            
            <li>1/2 cup Italian-style bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>1 tablespoon water</li>
<li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
<li>4 chicken breast cutlets, pounded to an even thickness (about 1 pound)</li>
<li>1 can (24 oz each) Hunt's® Tomato Basil Pasta Sauce, divided</li>
<li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
<li>8 ounces dry spaghetti, uncooked</li>
<li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, optional</li>
</ul>
        </p>

        <ol>

<p><li>Prepare the chicken. Place each halved chicken breast between 2 sheets of plastic wrap or in a freezer bag. Carefully flatten the chicken breasts with a rolling pin to achieve uniform thickness, about ½-inch thick. Don’t pound the breasts too hard. Pat dry each breast completely with a paper towel and season with 1 teaspoon salt. Set aside for at least 10 minutes</li></p>

</ol>
<ol><p>
    Then, add garlic and sauté for another 2 minutes until fragrant. Add tomato sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, parsley, and salt. Stir well to combine and bring the sauce to a simmer. Turn to low heat and let it simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer sauce into a bowl.
    Now, let's assemble the chicken parmesan and bake. In the same skillet (or in another cast-iron skillet or casserole dish), evenly spread ½ cup of the sauce on the bottom. Place the chicken breasts spaced evenly apart over the sauce. Cover each breast with ¼ cup sauce, and top each breast with a slice of mozzarella cheese and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle finely chopped parsley on top.
