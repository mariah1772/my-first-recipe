    <h2><b>How to Coat 
        Chicken Parmesan</b></h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                
                    <b>Ingredients </b>
                
            
            <li>1/2 cup Italian-style bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>1 tablespoon water</li>
<li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
<li>4 chicken breast cutlets, pounded to an even thickness (about 1 pound)</li>
<li>1 can (24 oz each) Hunt's® Tomato Basil Pasta Sauce, divided</li>
<li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
<li>8 ounces dry spaghetti, uncooked</li>
<li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, optional</li>
</ul>
        </p>

        <ol>

<p><li>Prepare the chicken. Place each halved chicken breast between 2 sheets of plastic wrap or in a freezer bag. Carefully flatten the chicken breasts with a rolling pin to achieve uniform thickness, about ½-inch thick. Don’t pound the breasts too hard. Pat dry each breast completely with a paper towel and season with 1 teaspoon salt. Set aside for at least 10 minutes</li>

&nbsp;

    <li>Then, add garlic and sauté for another 2 minutes until fragrant. Add tomato sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, parsley, and salt. Stir well to combine and bring the sauce to a simmer. Turn to low heat and let it simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer sauce into a bowl.
        Now, let's assemble the chicken parmesan and bake. In the same skillet (or in another cast-iron skillet or casserole dish), evenly spread ½ cup of the sauce on the bottom. Place the chicken breasts spaced evenly apart over the sauce. Cover each breast with ¼ cup sauce, and top each breast with a slice of mozzarella cheese and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle finely chopped parsley on top.</li>

        &nbsp;
     
        <li>Then, heat oil in a non stick cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat for 2 minutes until the hot oil is sizzling and shimmering. Pan fry the chicken breasts for about 4-5 minutes on each side until golden and crispy. Set aside on a plate. The chicken should be almost fully cooked and the internal temperature should reach above 155 F, as measured on a meat thermometer.
    Then, prepare the tomato sauce. Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the hot oil in the skillet. Add onions and sauté for 2 minutes until soft and tender.</li>
    &nbsp;
    <li>Bake in a 425F preheated oven for 15-20 minutes until the cheese melts and turns golden brown. Serve with spaghetti and garnish with more parsley on top.</li>

<h1><b>SHRIMP FAJITAS</b></h1>
<ul>
<b>Ingredients </b>
<li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
<li>2 cups sliced bell peppers red, orange, yellow or a combination</li>
<li>2 teaspoons chili powder</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon onion powder</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
<li>2 tablespoons chopped cilantro</li>

</ul>


<ol>
    <li>
<p>
    To make these easy and delicious Shrimp Fajitas, you will need the following ingredients (full measurements in recipe card below):

shrimp - I recommend using large white shrimp but you can feel free to use any type of shrimp that you like. I also kept the tails on when cooking, but I recommend removing the tails if you are planning to serve them with tortillas (for easy eating).
fajita seasoning - we seasoned the shrimp with a homemade fajita seasoning blend of chili powder, ground cumin, paprika, garlic powder, and dried oregano.
oil - we used avocado oil, but feel free to use any vegetable oil that you have on hand.
vegetables - I used a variety of different colored bell peppers (feel free to use any color combination that you want), along with onions and garlic. You can also add in other quick-cooking such as green beans, zucchini, or sliced mushrooms.
salt and pepper
lime juice
cilantro
tortillas - optional, if serving with tortillas. Feel free to use corn tortillas or flour tortillas.
</p>
 </li>
<h2>You will also need measuring cups and spoons, mixing bowl, and large skillet.</h2>
<li>HOW TO MAKE THE BEST SHRIMP FAJITAS

    1-Season the shrimp. In a medium mixing bowl or ziploc bag, add shrimp, chili powder, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, and oregano. Mix well until evenly coated, and set aside.
    
    2-Sauté vegetables. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the hot oil sizzles, about 1 minute. Add onion, garlic, and bell peppers and cook until soft, about 3-5 minutes.
    
    3-Cook shrimp. Add the seasoned shrimp and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Stir well and cook until the shrimp turn pink and is cooked through on both sides, about 4-5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir in lime juice and cilantro, and mix well to combine.
    
    4-Serve. Serve immediately with tortillas or rice, if desired.</li>
