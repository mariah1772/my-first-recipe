        Chicken Parmesan</h2>
    </article>
            <h3<b>Ingredients </b></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup Italian-style bread crumbs</li>
                <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
                <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
                <li>4 chicken breast cutlets, pounded to an even thickness (about 1 pound)</li>
                <li>1 can (24 oz each) Hunt's® Tomato Basil Pasta Sauce, divided</li>
                <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>8 ounces dry spaghetti, uncooked</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, optional</li>
            </ul>
      

        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the chicken. Place each halved chicken breast between 2 sheets of plastic wrap or in a freezer bag. Carefully flatten the chicken breasts with a rolling pin to achieve uniform thickness, about ½-inch thick. Don’t pound the breasts too hard. Pat dry each breast completely with a paper towel and season with 1 teaspoon salt. Set aside for at least 10 minutes</li>
    <li>Then, add garlic and sauté for another 2 minutes until fragrant. Add tomato sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, parsley, and salt. Stir well to combine and bring the sauce to a simmer. Turn to low heat and let it simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer sauce into a bowl.
        Now, let's assemble the chicken parmesan and bake. In the same skillet (or in another cast-iron skillet or casserole dish), evenly spread ½ cup of the sauce on the bottom. Place the chicken breasts spaced evenly apart over the sauce. Cover each breast with ¼ cup sauce, and top each breast with a slice of mozzarella cheese and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle finely chopped parsley on top.</li>
        <li>Then, heat oil in a non stick cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat for 2 minutes until the hot oil is sizzling and shimmering. Pan fry the chicken breasts for about 4-5 minutes on each side until golden and crispy. Set aside on a plate. The chicken should be almost fully cooked and the internal temperature should reach above 155 F, as measured on a meat thermometer.
    Then, prepare the tomato sauce. Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the hot oil in the skillet. Add onions and sauté for 2 minutes until soft and tender.</li>
    <li>Bake in a 425F preheated oven for 15-20 minutes until the cheese melts and turns golden brown. Serve with spaghetti and garnish with more parsley on top.</li>
